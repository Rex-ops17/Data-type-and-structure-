        "Data Types and Structures Questions\n",
        "\n",
        " * Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are important for efficient data management, algorithm design, and optimizing program performance.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Mutable: Can be changed after creation. Example: list = [1, 2, 3] (can add/remove elements). Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation. Example: string = \"hello\" (cannot change individual characters, only create new strings).\n",
        "\n",
        " * Lists: Ordered, mutable collections of items. Enclosed in []. Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections of items. Enclosed in ().\n",
        "\n",
        " * Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. Each key is unique and maps to a specific value.\n",
        "\n",
        " * To store a collection of unique items, where order doesn't matter, and for efficient set operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
        "\n",
        " * A string is an immutable sequence of characters. It differs from a list because a list is a mutable sequence of any data type.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Tuples ensure data integrity by being immutable. Once created, their elements cannot be changed, preventing accidental modification.\n",
        "\n",
        " * A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, which maps keys to values. In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Yes, lists can contain different data types (e.g., [1, \"hello\", 3.14, True]).\n",
        "\n",
        " * Strings are immutable because once a string is created, its content cannot be altered. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Dictionaries offer faster lookup times by key, are useful for representing structured data (like records), and allow for more descriptive access to data via keys.\n",
        "\n",
        " * A tuple would be preferable over a list for representing fixed collections of related data, such as a coordinate point (x, y) or RGB color (red, green, blue), where the values should not change.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Sets handle duplicate values by automatically storing only unique elements. If you try to add a duplicate, it's ignored.\n",
        "\n",
        " * The \"in\" keyword checks for membership. For lists, it checks if an item exists within the list. For dictionaries, it checks if a key exists within the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        " * No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple. Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        " * A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values themselves are other dictionaries. Example: {'user1': {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}, 'user2': {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}}. Use case: storing complex, hierarchical data.\n",
        "\n",
        " * The time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary is O(1) on average (constant time).\n",
        "\n",
        " * Lists are preferred when the order of elements is important, when duplicates are allowed, when the collection needs to be frequently modified (adding/removing elements), and when accessing elements by index.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Dictionaries are considered unordered because, in older Python versions, the order of insertion was not guaranteed. While modern Python (3.7+) preserves insertion order, they are fundamentally designed for key-based lookups rather than ordered iteration, and their primary benefit isn't sequential access. This doesn't affect data retrieval by key, which remains efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        " * List: Data is retrieved by numerical index (position). Accessing list[0], list[1], etc. Dictionary: Data is retrieved by unique keys. Accessing dictionary['key_name'].\n",
